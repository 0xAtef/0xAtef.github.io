# SOARing with The Hive Project

## Introduction

The "SOARing with The Hive" project aims to enhance the capabilities of a Security Operations Center (SOC) team by implementing a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solution. This project integrates various tools, including The Hive, Cortex, QRadar, MISP, n8n, shuffle and Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), to streamline and automate security incident response processes.

## Project Components

The project consists of several key components:

### 1. The Hive and Cortex

- **Description:** The Hive is an open-source incident response platform that enables the centralization of security incident information, while Cortex is its companion tool for automated analysis and response.
- **Installation:** Both The Hive and Cortex can be installed together on the same server with Elastic as a backend for storage and indexing.

### 2. QRadar

- **Description:** IBM QRadar is a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution that provides real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities for security incidents.
- **Integration:** QRadar is integrated into the SOAR workflow to provide real-time threat detection and alerting.

### 3. MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform & Threat Sharing)

- **Description:** MISP is an open-source threat intelligence platform designed to improve the sharing of structured threat information.
- **Integration:** MISP is integrated into the SOAR workflow to provide threat intelligence feeds and contextual information for incident analysis.

### 4. n8n & shuffle

- **Description:** n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that allows you to create automated workflows by connecting various services and applications.
- **Integration:** n8n & shuffle is used to orchestrate and automate incident response processes, integrating all the tools mentioned above, and facilitating communication between them.

### 5. Automated Daily Reporting with Python

- **Description:** Python scripts are used to automate the generation of daily reports. These reports include metrics such as detection time and handling time per alert.
- **Integration:** Python scripts extract data from The Hive, Cortex, and other sources to calculate SLA metrics, providing insights into incident response performance.

### 6. Custom Cortex Responder

- **Description:** A custom responder is developed for Cortex to add extra response capabilities tailored to specific use cases.
- **Integration:** The custom responder enhances incident response by executing custom actions based on predefined rules and conditions.

### 7. Integration with Microsoft Teams

- **Description:** Integration with Microsoft Teams enables real-time notifications to the SOC team, especially senior and above members, for escalated cases or critical notifications.
- **Integration:** Microsoft Teams is integrated into the SOAR workflow, allowing automatic notifications and collaboration among SOC team members.

## Installation Architecture

The installation architecture for "SOARing with The Hive" is designed to provide a unified and efficient SOAR environment. Here's a high-level overview of the installation:

### 1. "All-in-One" for The Hive, Cortex, and Elastic

- **Components:**
  - The Hive: Incident Response Platform
  - Cortex: Automated Analysis and Response
  - Elastic Stack: Backend for storage and indexing

- **Installation Steps:**
  1. Deploy a dedicated server or virtual machine.
  2. Install the Elastic Stack, including Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
  3. Set up and configure The Hive and Cortex on the same server, connecting them to Elasticsearch for data storage.

### 2. MISP Integration

- **Components:**
  - MISP: Threat Intelligence Platform

- **Integration Steps:**
  1. Deploy a dedicated MISP server or instance.
  2. Configure MISP to ingest threat intelligence feeds and share information with The Hive and Cortex.

### 3. n8n Orchestration

- **Components:**
  - n8n: Workflow Automation

- **Integration Steps:**
  1. Deploy n8n on a dedicated server or container.
  2. Create workflows in n8n to automate incident response processes.
  3. Integrate n8n with The Hive, Cortex, QRadar, MISP, and any other relevant tools.

## Conclusion

The "SOARing with The Hive" project leverages the power of SOAR to empower SOC teams to respond more effectively to security incidents. By integrating The Hive, Cortex, QRadar, MISP, and n8n, shuffle , this project provides a comprehensive and efficient solution for incident detection, analysis, and response. The installation architecture outlined above ensures a streamlined and unified SOAR environment.
