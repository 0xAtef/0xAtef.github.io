## About Me

I’m a **Senior Cyber Defense Engineer** specializing in **Digital Forensics**, **Incident Response**, **Threat Hunting**, **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**, and **SOC Operations**.

I focus on integrating and automating detection and response workflows using tools like **TIP**, **SOAR**, **SIEM**, **EDR**, **Mail Security Gateways**, and **Python**, enabling efficient threat detection, investigation, and mitigation across SOC environments.

My experience includes evaluating and deploying security solutions—**EDR**, **TIP**, **ASM**, **DRP**, and **Dark Web Monitoring**—and ensuring they’re effectively embedded into the SOC ecosystem. I’m skilled in conducting endpoint investigations, building detection use cases, and refining SOC processes for optimal performance.

I hold certifications in **Threat Hunting** and **Windows Forensics**, and I’ve led CTI initiatives including **CTI-SOP development** and **platform integration** to boost threat detection and response efficiency.
