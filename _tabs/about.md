## About Me

**Senior Cyber Defense DFIR Analyst** with a strong focus on **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**, **threat detection engineering**, and **threat hunting**. While formally positioned within DFIR, my role spans across threat intelligence engineering, SOC architecture, and detection strategy, driving proactive defense initiatives and intelligence-led security operations.

I lead the development of **CTI strategies**, **SOPs**, and **tooling**, including custom-built platforms like **"ThreatOps"**‚Äîa CTI automation tool designed to collect, parse, and operationalize RSS-based intelligence feeds, enriching internal security insights and empowering enterprise-wide threat programs.

With a foundation in **SOC operations**, including analysis, administration, and engineering, I bring prior experience in architecting and integrating core security solutions (`SIEM`, `SOAR`, `EDR`, `TIPs`, `ASM`, `DRP`), building end-to-end detection pipelines, and optimizing intelligence workflows.

Actively engaged in **purple teaming** to validate detection logic and enhance visibility. While my current DFIR responsibilities are more strategic than deep-dive forensics, I maintain hands-on capability in **incident response**, **enrichment-driven triage**, and **light DFIR investigations**.

**Certified in Threat Hunting and Windows Forensics**, I continuously contribute to threat-informed defense models, develop custom detection content, and ensure the seamless integration of CTI into SOC workflows. My mission is to bridge **intelligence**, **engineering**, and **response** into a unified, adaptive cyber defense capability.
